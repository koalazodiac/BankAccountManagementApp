# BankAccountManagementApp
## Description
This project consists of a single Python file, _Bank Account Management App.py_, and a sample data file, _accounts.txt_. It simulates a banking system with functionalities including withdrawal, deposit, transfer, displaying all accounts, creating accounts, creating/updating passwords, and displaying balances. Additionally, the application generates a log file, _AccountsLog.txt_, which records the access times for each account. Basic input validations are also implemented, such as verifying the bank account type, password, interest rate, and account existence.
